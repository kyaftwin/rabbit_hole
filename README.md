# rabbit_hole
going down rabbit holes are a necessary evil to satisfy curiosity and discover new opportunities, so i believe going down them is good.  
the only downside is spending TOO much time in a single rabbit hole since i also yearn to discover a breadth of other things. to prevent going too deep, i need to deliberately pause and restart my "research" sessions. if i am in a rabbit hole for more than x hours, i need to look for a good time to pause and conclude my findings. 

the pausing (reflection) routine is the most important. i need to formulate a concise opinion with supporting evidence from the "research" conducted. considering questions such as: 
- any concepts that i can relate to other parts of my life?
- any assumptions that i either validated or contradicted?
- any topics that i am curious to research next time?
- any resources i should reference if i were to pick up where i left of?

# template

- rabbit hole #0
- opinion (write last)
- supporting evidence (3 - 5)
- resources
  
- rough notes
  - concepts that i can relate to other parts of my life
  - assumptions that i validated or contradicted
  - topics to research next time

# future ideas
- [ ] add template to obsidian / deploy as 
- [ ] add rabbit hole entry to spaced repetition scheduler like the one anki uses to revisit the topic later before its forgotten, or archive the entry if the interest is no longer there.
